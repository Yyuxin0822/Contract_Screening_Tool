# Contract_Screening_Tool

This tool provides a preliminary screening of your contract language document.
It only accepts .docx file format. If you have other format files, such as .pdf, .doc, 
please use the format conversion tool in Adobe or MicrosoftWords to process the file before continuing.

The tool will generate two documents, highlight.docx and report.docx. It does not read tables and images. 
**Highlight.docx** highlights the sentences that include sensitive words.
**Report.docx** includes the count of sensitive words and the suggestions for modifying the terms. 

For any privacy concerns, this tool will never store your file. 
If you have any questions or feedbacks, please contact Yuxin Yang at yyuxin0822@gmail.com
